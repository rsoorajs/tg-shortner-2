Telegram Bot to shorten urls with Kutt.it

Very feature-light bot that breaks easily, but does the trick. Really easy to setup; just set the following env vars: `API_KEY` is your Kutt API Key, `DOMAIN` is the domain to shorten to, `BOT_TOKEN` is the token for the Telegram bot, and `USERNAME` is the user authorized to shorten links.
